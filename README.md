### Hello, I'm Viet ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m working as a front-end developer based in Singapore.

Nothing makes me feel more fulfilled than actively contributing positive impacts. Tech is the place I find my motivation and creativity flow, and I believe with the right blend with interpersonal skills, it could bring solutions to all life problems.

When Iâ€™m not working, you can find me <br>
:dancers: dancing, <br>
:palm_tree: enjoying nature, or maybe <br>
:ramen: cooking!
