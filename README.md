### Hello, I'm Viet 👋

As a front-end developer, nothing makes me feel more fulfilled than actively contributing positive impacts. Tech is the place I find my motivation and creativity flow, and I believe with the right blend with interpersonal skills, it could bring solutions to almost all life problems.

When I’m not working, you can find me <br>
:dancers: dancing, <br>
:palm_tree: enjoying nature, or maybe <br>
:ramen: cooking!
